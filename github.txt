remote and add origin :copy paste from github :  This the specific file we want  to add our project 

first add the ssh key : using the docs how to add 

sending to internet is called :git push -u origin master (-u is for nexttime if i want to push i do not have to write origin master again ) 


getting from internet is called :git pull origin master 


How to get different of files :  git diff filename.format 
How to get different of staged  files :  git diff --staged  filename.format 


rollback the staged back : git reset filename.format   then git checkout filename.txt


back the file but not staged : git checkout .



clone some others repo :git clone sshkeyfromother . (add . for no to make new folder )

if you do not want to track some file :touch .gitignore (male a git ignore file )
                                       notepad .gitignore (add all  .format you want to ignore refet to the ignore docs of git ignore for different codes)

make a new  branch of so that the code is safe you are working in the copy :
  
     git branch  (display the branches )
     git branch BRANCHNAME
     git checkout BRANCHNAME(shifting to the branch you want to work )

merge two into one : you have to come in master 
                     git merge BRANCHNAME(MERGE INTO the master )
                     then push 

delete the later branch after merge it  :git branch -d BRANCHNAME(delete from your local computer)
 git push origin  --delete BRANCHNAME (delete from the github)
